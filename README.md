Aim: to learn how to use Git and Github.

Things I think I need to cover
  - local repo git initiation
  - linking local repo to server repo (i.e. Github)
  - making (sensible!) branches
  - pushing commits to a non-master branch
  - attaching comments to commits
  - pulling commits to master from a non-master branch
  - ... learning to explore Github and public repos
